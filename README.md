# COAL

A fast, codon-aware alternative to [PAL2NAL](https://www.bork.embl.de/pal2nal/):
it maps unaligned coding DNA onto an existing protein multiple sequence alignment
to produce a codon alignment.

Built at the Reinvent the Wheel AI × Science Tool-building Hackathon, London, October 2026.

> **Status:** early development. No COAL implementation yet.

## Reference implementation (PAL2NAL)

COAL is an independent implementation. PAL2NAL v14 is used only as a
black-box reference for differential testing and benchmarking. Its distribution
has no licence file, so **it is not included in this repository** and its code
and test data must not be copied here.

To fetch it locally (into `PAL2NAL/`, which is git-ignored):

```
python scripts/fetch_pal2nal.py
```

If the download is blocked, put `pal2nal.v14.tar.gz` (downloaded from the
official site in a browser) in the repo root and run:

```
python scripts/fetch_pal2nal.py --archive pal2nal.v14.tar.gz
```

Run it (requires Perl 5):

```
perl PAL2NAL/pal2nal.v14/pal2nal.pl pep.aln nuc.fasta -output fasta > out.fa 2> out.err
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Perl 5 (only for running the PAL2NAL reference)

## Licence

COAL is released under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`). This does not cover PAL2NAL.
