# Benchmark results

A larger benchmark (Windows, commit `47f57f1`, up to 1,000,000 sequences, real Ensembl Compara trees, all four
tools: PAL2NAL v14, PAL2NAL v16, the COAL Python and C++ engines) is on the `bench/windows-47f57f1` branch and will
replace the numbers below once merged. The numbers below are from earlier versions of the Python engine (the
commit is named in each section).

## COAL vs PAL2NAL v14 (v0.3)

COAL vs PAL2NAL v14 on synthetic datasets (see `benchmarks/README.md`). Each run is one
command-line process, timed from start to finish (including Perl/Python start-up).
Times are the median of 3 runs; COAL ran as a single process (`-j 1`), with the Python engine at an earlier
commit (`58a1219`, see below). **On these benchmark datasets every COAL output was byte-identical to PAL2NAL v14's.**

| Sequences × codons | Total codons | PAL2NAL | COAL | Speedup | Peak memory PAL2NAL / COAL |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 10 × 500 | 5 k | 0.051 s | 0.061 s | 0.8× | 13 / 15 MB |
| 100 × 100 | 10 k | 0.077 s | 0.062 s | 1.3× | 11 / 15 MB |
| 100 × 500 | 50 k | 0.265 s | 0.072 s | 3.7× | 15 / 15 MB |
| 100 × 2,000 | 200 k | 1.36 s | 0.093 s | 14.6× | 23 / 17 MB |
| 1,000 × 500 | 500 k | 2.39 s | 0.139 s | 17.3× | 35 / 19 MB |
| 100 × 10,000 | 1 M | 24.5 s | 0.207 s | **118.6×** | 55 / 23 MB |
| 10,000 × 500 | 5 M | 24.7 s | 0.864 s | **28.6×** | 219 / 55 MB |

What the numbers show:

- **More sequences:** COAL is 17–29× faster from 1,000 sequences upward.
- **Longer genes:** PAL2NAL's time grows much faster than the gene length: 5× more codons
  (2,000 → 10,000) took 18× longer. COAL's time grows in proportion to the input, so the gap
  widens with gene length.
- **Tiny inputs:** both tools take about 0.05 s, which is mostly start-up time.

Machine: Windows 11, Intel 64-bit CPU (Family 6 Model 183), Python 3.13.9, Strawberry Perl 5.42.3, COAL commit
`58a1219`. Raw data: `benchmarks/results/bench_windows_20261016_2356.{csv,txt}`.

**Limitations:** synthetic data only (random ancestral gene, about 10% of codons changed, about 5% deleted; no UTRs or
frameshifts in the benchmark data, although COAL handles both); one machine; 3 repeats. Speedups depend on the
machine and dataset.

## Scaling (v0.3)

Synthetic data, 500 codons per gene, on the same Windows 11 machine as above (20 logical CPUs). One run per
configuration. All outputs were byte-identical.

| Sequences | Input size | 1 process | 4 processes | All cores (20) | Peak memory, 1 process |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 100,000 | 194 MB | 7.1 s | 2.4 s | 2.5 s | 55 MB |
| 500,000 | 974 MB | 25.2 s | 9.8 s | 10.0 s | 131 MB |

- **Memory** stays small: v0.2 needed about 2.5 GB for the 500,000-sequence input (measured on Linux).
- **Throughput** is about 100 MB of input per second with 4 processes. PAL2NAL was not run at these sizes; from its
  10,000-sequence time (24.7 s), and assuming it grows in proportion, it would need roughly 4 and 21 minutes.
- **More than 4 processes don't help yet.** The main process reads all the DNA, passes it to the workers and writes
  all the output, and that is now the bottleneck.

Raw data: `benchmarks/results/bench_windows_20261017_0059.csv` (500,000) and the 100,000 row of
`bench_windows_20261017_0055.csv`. That file's 500,000 row is not used: its 1-process column was accidentally
timed with automatic `-j`. Memory is measured for the main process only.

On the 2-core Linux development machine (v0.2 → v0.3, 1 process): 100,000 sequences 6.3 s → 3.6 s,
515 → 87 MB; 500,000 sequences 32.0 s → 17.0 s, 2,523 → 143 MB.

Reproduce with `python benchmarks/run_bench.py --no-pal2nal --sizes 100000x500 500000x500 --coal-jobs 4 0`.

## Reproduce

```
python scripts/fetch_pal2nal.py            # once; PAL2NAL is not redistributed
pip install -e . psutil                    # psutil only for the memory columns
python benchmarks/run_bench.py --repeats 3 --perl /path/to/perl
```

The script generates the same datasets every time (fixed random seed), times both tools,
checks their outputs match, and writes `benchmarks/results/<name>.csv` plus a `.txt` file
with the machine and software versions.
