# Overnight log: core (branch overnight/core)

(Morning summary will be written here at the end.)

## Progress log

- 2026-10-17 01:17 UTC | task 0 | preflight OK: cmake 4.4.4 + g++ 11.4, C++17 + std::thread hello-world built and ran (2 hardware threads). Branched overnight/core from main 31cf3d0 (pull: already up to date).
- 2026-10-17 01:17 UTC | task 1 | Python 279/279 golden checks (all variants: fasta, clustal, paml, codon, nogap, nomismatch, codon tables), C++ n/a | added -output clustal/paml/codon; test_differential checks every variant; -j1 == -j2/-j3 tests for every format.
- 2026-10-17 01:25 UTC | task 2 | Python 279/279, C++ 279/279 golden checks | C++17 core in cpp/src (tables, core, seqio, main) + root CMakeLists.txt (coal_core static lib + coal-cpp exe). Whole port compiled warning-free and passed every golden check on the first build, so there were no intermediate counts to commit. test_differential runs either engine (COAL_IMPL=python|cpp, COAL_CPP_BIN) and has a --count mode.

## Decisions

- Output-format conventions were taken from the goldens, plus a few black-box runs of PAL2NAL v14 in a scratch folder outside the repo (only its *output* was looked at; no code read or copied, nothing from it committed):
  - CLUSTAL/codon name column = max(10, longest ID) + 4 characters; CLUSTAL blocks of 60 nt, no conservation line; empty alignment = header only.
  - PAML header = `%4d%7d` (sequences, length); sequence wrapped at 60; empty sequence = empty line.
  - codon: residue line and codon line are cut into blocks of 20 *independently* (residues vs. triplets), as PAL2NAL does.
  - PAL2NAL refuses `-output codon` with -nogap/-nomismatch; COAL does the same (error, exit 1) instead of inventing a layout.
- Known PAL2NAL quirk NOT reproduced: in `-output codon`, when a column is widened by a frameshift digit 4/5, PAL2NAL sometimes inserts an extra '-' in the residue line (seen for a lone '4' or '4'+'5' in a column, but not for a lone '5', '4'+'2', or the frameshift_mixed fixture). The rule could not be pinned down in 3 probes; COAL prints one residue per column (matches all goldens). Parked.

## Not checked against PAL2NAL (combinations without goldens)

- `-output paml` / `-output clustal` with -nogap or -nomismatch (unit-tested: same rows as FASTA output).
- `-output clustal|paml|codon` with -codontable N (only the FASTA variants have goldens for codon tables).
- `-output codon` with frameshift digits 4/5 in long alignments (see quirk above).

## Needs a human decision

- `build/` should be added to .gitignore (I may not edit .gitignore).
- An untracked `Claude outputs/` folder exists in the repo root (not created by this session); left untouched.
